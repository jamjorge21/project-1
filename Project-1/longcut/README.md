The Long Cut:  
As an adventurer without any knowledge of certain trails  
I would like to see suggestions to try  
I would like a profile page to save my information and track routes completed  
I would like to be able to choose from hiking or driving  
I would like a list of trails available in California  
When I select a trail I would like to see a map of them  
When I am using the map, I would like to be able to move my markers to a location of my choice
